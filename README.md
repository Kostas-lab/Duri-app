## Simple and fast design

* The user interface was designed for simple and fast operation. A complete inventory is created in just a few minutes from scratch.
* Quick stock quantity update
* Increment or decrement stock quantities by just one click.
* Searchable item list
* The item list can be displayed by ID or by description. Items are searched automatically for a complete or partial match whenever the user enters text or scans a barcode.
* Data import and data export
* Data import and data export from/to CSV files (e.g. created with Microsoft Excel), XML files and Google Drive spreadsheets is in to do list .
* Built-in camera barcode scanner
* The built-in camera barcode scanner reliably decodes most linear and 2D codes.
* Bluetooth barcode scanner support
* Barcodes can be scanned with the integrated camera scanner or with industry-grade external Bluetooth barcode scanners (Bluetooth SPP required) . External scanners are recommended for a better scanning experience and improved efficiency.
* Optimized for smart phones and tablets
* On tablets the app displays the relevant data (item list view and item detail view) on a single screen. On smart phones these views are separated.
